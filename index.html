        <h2>What is FM WhatsApp?</h2>
        <p>FM WhatsApp is a modified version of the original WhatsApp messenger. This mod was developed by a third-party developer (not by WhatsApp Inc.) and offers a ton of new features. It’s often referred to as a "WhatsApp mod" because it provides extra functionalities that make your chatting experience a bit more fun and, well, unique.</p>
        <p>The primary reason people switch from the official WhatsApp to <a href="https://fmappdownload.com/" target="_blank">fm whatsapp latest version</a> is the extensive customization options it offers. Think about adding custom themes, hiding your online status, and having even more privacy control. If you’re someone who likes to tweak things to your liking, FM WhatsApp might just be the app you never knew you needed.</p>
    </section>

        <h2>Features of FM WhatsApp</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Customization Galore:</strong> FM WhatsApp offers you several options to modify the look of your app. You can change themes, fonts, and even the chat bubbles.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy Control:</strong> You can hide your "Last Seen" status, blue ticks, or even the second tick (the one that lets others know you've seen their message). You can also hide the "typing..." and "recording..." indicators.</li>
            <li><strong>Multiple Accounts:</strong> FM WhatsApp allows you to use multiple WhatsApp accounts on the same device. You can easily switch between personal and work accounts or a second number.</li>
            <li><strong>Media Sharing:</strong> Unlike the original WhatsApp, FM WhatsApp allows you to share larger files. Send videos up to 1 GB, while WhatsApp limits it to just 16 MB.</li>
            <li><strong>Anti-Ban Feature:</strong> FM WhatsApp comes with an anti-ban feature, meaning you don’t have to worry too much about getting banned from WhatsApp, but caution is still advised.</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced Emojis:</strong> You can use a wider range of emojis, including those from iOS, bringing a little taste of the Apple emoji keyboard to your Android device.</li>
            <li><strong>App Lock:</strong> FM WhatsApp includes an app lock feature, allowing you to set a PIN or pattern lock for added security.</li>
            <li><strong>Hide Media from Gallery:</strong> Hide specific media from your gallery to maintain privacy, especially for sensitive content.</li>
            <li><strong>More Group Members:</strong> FM WhatsApp allows you to add up to 500 members in a group, compared to WhatsApp's 256-member limit.</li>
        </ul>
